## Django Ninja

Django Ninja is a web framework built on top of Django, designed for rapidly building RESTful APIs. It is heavily inspired by FastAPI and aims to bring similar benefits to Django, focusing on speed, simplicity, and type safety.

Key features:

Easy: Designed to be easy to use and intuitive.
FAST execution: Very high performance thanks to Pydantic and async support.
Fast to code: Type hints and automatic docs lets you focus only on business logic.
Standards-based: Based on the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.
Django friendly: (obviously) has good integration with the Django core and ORM.
