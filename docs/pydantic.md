# Pydantic

Pydantic is Pythonâ€™s most popular data validation library that can turn type hints into runtime validation rules.

Instead of writing dozens of if isinstance() checks and custom validation functions, you define your data structure once using familiar Python syntax.

Pydantic handles the rest: validating incoming data, converting types when appropriate, and providing clear error messages when validation fails.
